        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello again! I&apos;m Solomon Chokor. A Software Engineer with a Focus
          on Front-end Engineering. I got into software engineering after
          various failed attempts at building my own product with limited coding
          experience. These days I enjoy building user interfaces which are
          accessible, usable, performant and scalable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asides anything code, I enjoy cooking, reading, movies and meaningful
          conversations. I know I said asides &#128579;, but I also enjoy
          talking about the web and helping those around me become better
          developers whilst learning from them.
        </p>
